    Before filming the second season of its popular TV series <a href="http://www.vpro.nl/nederland-van-boven.html">Nederland van Boven</a>, the VPRO invited designers, developers and data scientists to pitch new concepts and ideas. I worked together with <a href="http://bvh.me/">Boris van Hoytema</a> and <a href="http://rafecopeland.co.nz/">Rafe Copeland</a> of <a href="http://non-fiction.eu/2012/06/02/visualising-flight-traffic-for-nederland-van-boven/">Non-fiction</a>, to create data visualizations which combined real-world paper maps and 3D animations.
