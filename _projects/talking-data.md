    in 2013, Waag Society was part of <a href="http://waag.org/en/event/nuit-blanche-talking-data">Nuit Blanche</a>, a night festival in the centre of Amsterdam. With Talking Data, visitors could tell their personal story by selecting places on a map. This way, visitors created shapes that could be created, from wood or plastic, in Waag Society's <a href="http://fablab.waag.org/">Fablab</a>.

    We mostly used the Fablab's laser cutter, but some liked it a bit bigger.

    The project is open source, and available on <a href="https://github.com/bertspaan/talking-data">GitHub</a>. Built by <a href="https://nl.linkedin.com/in/laurensschuurkamp">Laurens Schuurkamp</a> and me, we used Ruby/Sinatra to build an API, PostGIS to store the data, and D3.js, Leaflet, and we used <a href="http://maps.stamen.com/toner/#12/37.7706/-122.3782">Stamen's Toner map</a> in the front-end application.
