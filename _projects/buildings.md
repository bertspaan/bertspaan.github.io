    <i>All 9,866,539 buildings in the Netherlands</i> is an <a href="http://code.waag.org/buildings">interactive online map</a>, showing all buildings in the Netherlands shaded by their age of construction. The map shows data from the <a href="http://www.kadaster.nl/bag"><i>Basisregistraties Adressen en Gebouwen</i></a> (BAG), an open dataset provided by the Dutch goverment containing all addresses and buildings in the country.

    By showing the buildings on a black background, the map provides a new view on differences in urban planning throughout the centuries. Throughout the centuries, the Dutch always have built their towns and cities near rivers, canals and lakes; even by only showing buildings, these bodies of water are still clearly visible in the shape of the black background. The map was made with <a href="https://tilemill-project.github.io/tilemill/">TileMill</a>, an open source map design studio by Mapbox. All code and documentation needed to create the map is available on <a href="https://github.com/bertspaan/buildings">GitHub</a>.
