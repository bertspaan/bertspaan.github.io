    <a href="http://code.waag.org/buildings">Interactive online map</a>, showing all 9,866,539 buildings in the Netherlands shaded by their age of construction. The map shows data from the <a href="http://www.kadaster.nl/bag"><i>Basisregistraties Adressen en Gebouwen</i></a> (BAG), an open data set containing all addresses and buildings in the Netherlands. By showing the buildings on a black background, the map provides a new view on differences in urban planning throughout the centuries.
