    The <a href="http://spacetime.nypl.org/">NYC Space/Time Directory</a> is a two-year project funded by the <a href="http://www.knightfoundation.org/">John S. and James L. Knight Foundation</a>. The aim of this project is to create tools, datasets, and visualizations to make it easier to explore the New York Public Library’s collections of maps, photos and other digitized items, through space and time. I worked on this project as lead engineer and designer in NYPL’s Digital department, and I created <a href="http://spacetime.nypl.org/#data">a data platform for historical geospatial data</a>, <a href="http://spacetime.nypl.org/maps-by-decade">new ways to explore the Library’s historical maps</a>, <a href="http://spacetime.nypl.org/surveyor">a website for crowdsourced photo geotagging</a>, and many other <a href="http://spacetime.nypl.org/">open source libraries, apps and tutorials</a>.

      What does a searchable historical atlas of New York City look like? By combining and linking different historical datasets—streets traced from historical atlases, house numbers transcribed from fire insurance maps, georectified maps from our <a href="http://maps.nypl.org/warper">Map Warper</a>, and people and their professions from OCR’d <a href="https://digitalcollections.nypl.org/collections/new-york-city-directories#/?tab=about">New York city directories</a>—the NYC Space/Time Directory turns all this data into a searchable graph of New York City’s history, and makes finding our digitized historical materials much easier.

    In the fall of 2016, I started a meetup group to help grow the community around the project: <a href="https://www.meetup.com/historical-data-and-maps-at-nypl/">Historical Maps &amp; Data at NYPL</a>. Since then, I’ve organized different meetups at the Library and around the city, on a variety of subjects related to the project. During one of the meetups, historian <a href="https://twitter.com/jeremylechtzin">Jeremy Lechtzin</a> led a walking tour through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Heights">Brooklyn Heights</a> for which we used a selection of historical maps from the NYPL and a mobile website, developed just for this walking tour.
