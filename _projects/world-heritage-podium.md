    <a href="http://www.werelderfgoed.nl/podium/">The World Heritage Podium</a>, created by <a href="http://non-fiction.eu/2012/06/02/visualising-flight-traffic-for-nederland-van-boven/">Non-fiction</a>, is a permanent exhibition about UNESCO World Heritage in the Netherlands, on display in the <a href="http://stadsarchief.amsterdam.nl/">Amsterdam City Archives</a>. For this project, I composed geospatial data sets, and together with <a href="http://rafecopeland.co.nz/">Rafe Copeland</a> I worked on the base maps of all Dutch World Heritage sites.

   I worked with OpenStreetMap data, as well as with various other open data sources about the different sites.
