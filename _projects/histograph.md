    Histograph is a search engine, geocoder and gazetteer for historical place names, it allows to track and explore the changes in the names of places, streets, addresses and buildings over time. Histograph is part of <a href="http://erfgoedenlocatie.nl/">Heritage &amp; Location</a>, a large project about interinstitutional cultural heritage data, funded by the Dutch <a href="https://www.government.nl/ministries/ministry-of-education-culture-and-science">Ministry of Education, Culture and Science</a>.

    For Waag Society, <a href="http://defekt.nl/">Jelle Herold</a> and I developed a suite of data ingestion and transformation tools and a search API based on the <a>Neo4j graph database</a>. A web interface allowed librarians and archivists to search and visualize the gazetteer and find concordances, but users could also download the data for offline access to the complete dataset.
