    Started by in San Francisco in the summer of 2013, <a href="http://maptime.io/">Maptime</a> is an open learning environment for everybody interested in learning about making digital maps. Maptime started small, but after San Francisco many other American cities followed, and in November 2014, I organized the first edition of <a href="http://maptime-ams.github.io/">Maptime Amsterdam</a>. Many more will follow. <i>Maps for all forever!</i> And don't forget to take a look at the website I made for <a href="http://maptime-ams.github.io/">Maptime Amsterdam</a>: Amsterdam's buildings, rainbowy.

    <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Maptime-AMS/events/218595562/">Maptime Amsterdam #3</a> was about Mapbox Studio and CartoCSS. Making a map was never this easy, and at the end of the two-hour workshop, even some participants who had never used the software before created beautiful maps.

    But there's more to cartography than CartoCSS and JavaScript: during December's edition of Maptime Amsterdam, we worked on <a href="http://waag.org/en/blog/cartograms-and-one-dimensional-maps">hand-drawn one-dimensional maps</a>.
