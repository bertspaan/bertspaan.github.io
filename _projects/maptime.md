    Started in San Francisco in the summer of 2013, <a href="http://maptime.io/">Maptime</a> is an open learning environment for everybody interested in learning about making digital maps. Maptime started small, but after San Francisco many other American cities followed, and in November 2014, I organized the first edition of <a href="http://maptime-ams.github.io/">Maptime Amsterdam</a>. <i>Maps for all forever!</i> And don't forget to take a look at the website I made for <a href="http://maptime-ams.github.io/">Maptime Amsterdam</a>.

    <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Maptime-AMS/events/218595562/">Maptime Amsterdam #3</a> was about Mapbox Studio and CartoCSS. Making a map was never this easy, and at the end of the two-hour workshop, even some participants who had never used the software before created beautiful maps.

    But there's more to cartography than CartoCSS and JavaScript: during December's edition of Maptime Amsterdam, we worked on <a href="http://waag.org/en/blog/cartograms-and-one-dimensional-maps">hand-drawn one-dimensional maps</a>.

    The <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Maptime-AMS/events/220184224/">last Maptime night</a> I organized — in May 2015 — was one of my favorites: Amsterdam's most famous confectioner <a href="http://www.patisserieholtkamp.nl">Cees Holtkamp</a> took us on a walk around the neighbourhood. Mr. Holtkamp makes great cakes, but he knows everything about Amsterdam, too! Afterwards, Huib Morel and Hubert Kraaijvanger of the former Actiegroep Nieuwmarkt presented a unique slideshow about how the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nieuwmarkt">Nieuwmarkt</a> changed in the 70s and 80s.

    Luckily, Maptime Amsterdam continues without me, <a href="https://twitter.com/BNiene">Niene Boeijen</a> took over the organization of future sessions after I moved to New York City.
