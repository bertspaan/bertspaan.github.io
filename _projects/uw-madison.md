    In the winter and spring of 2008, I lived in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison,_Wisconsin">Madison, Wisconsin</a> for an exchange program at the <a href="http://www.wisc.edu/">University of Wisconsin–Madison</a>. During this semester, I followed two courses on cartography tought by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/mark-harrower/34/961/806">Mark Harrower</a> at the university’s <a href="https://geography.wisc.edu/">Department of Geography</a>.

    For the course <i>Introduction to Cartography</i>, we used ArcGIS and Adobe Illustrator to turn geospatial data into well-designed maps. For the other course, <i>Animated & Web-based Mapping</i>, I worked on interactive animated maps using Flash, and made a <a href="http://bertspaan.nl/files/uw-madison/animated-and-web-based-mapping/lab1.html">map of Madison airport outbound flights</a>, a <a href="http://bertspaan.nl/files/uw-madison/animated-and-web-based-mapping/lab2.html">map showing Wisconsin farm data through time</a>, and a <a href="http://bertspaan.nl/files/uw-madison/animated-and-web-based-mapping/lab3.html">map of the water flow in the Mississippi river</a>. Unfortunately, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Rainier">Mount Rainier</a> accident map made during the course’s final project—which won the 2008 <a href="http://nacis.org/awards/student-dynamic-map-competition/">NACIS Student dynamic map competition</a>—is no longer available online.
