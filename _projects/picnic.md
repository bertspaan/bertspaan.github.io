    At <a href="http://waag.org/en/project/picnic-festival">PICNIC Festival 2012</a>, <a href="http://waag.org/en">Waag Society</a> co-hosted a two-day open data workshop. For this event, Laurens Schuurkamp and I created an interactive installation, showing 33 open data sets with data about Amsterdam. The data was displayed on two big screens, and with an iPad, one could switch between layers, and pan and zoom the map.
