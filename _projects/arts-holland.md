    Arts Holland was a linked open data platform and API for Dutch event and culture data, developed by <a href="http://waag.org/en">Waag Society</a> in coorporation with the <a href="http://www.uitburo.nl/"> Nederlands Uitburo</a> and <a href="http://www.nbtc.nl/en/homepage.htm">NBTC</a>. The data contained event data for thousands of venues in the Netherlands, updated every hour.

    The image above is a detail of a visualization of all events that took place in the Netherlands, in one week in 2013. The complete visualization, shown here, was made with <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3.js</a>: the first ring of the <a href="https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Cluster-Layout"><i>cluster layout</i></a> shows all the towns with events in the Arts Holland database, the second ring shows all venues, and the last one all events.

      Arts Holland provided both a REST API and a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL">SPARQL</a> endpoint to access the data. To explain SPARQL and the available data in detail, I developed an interactive SPARQL tutorial which guides users of the API step by step through the query language and Arts Hollandâ€™s data model.
