     The map was made with <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/tilemill/">TileMill</a>, and is based on <a href="https://github.com/mapbox/osm-bright">OSM Bright</a>. The illuminated building effect was created by adding all the individual lines from all building polygons from OpenStreetMap to a new map layer, and randomly showing some of them â€” blurred and transparent yellow.
