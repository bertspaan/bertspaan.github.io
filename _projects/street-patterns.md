    Beautiful patterns can emerge from a city's street network. Historian and writer <a href="http://www.fredfeddes.nl/">Fred Feddes</a> told us during his talk on the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Maptime-AMS/events/220184211/">fifth edition</a> of <a href="../maptime">Maptime Amsterdam</a> that some of the patterns in the streets of Amsterdam are more than a 1000 years old. For this Maptime night, I created a <a href="http://maptime-ams.github.io/street-patterns/">tutorial</a> on creating <a href="http://dataphys.org/">physical data visualizations</a> of street patterns, using <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:highway">OpenStreetMap road data</a>, <a href="http://turfjs.org/">open source geospatial tools</a>, and <a href="http://fablab.waag.org/machines">Fablab machines</a>. The tutorial is <a href="https://github.com/maptime-ams/street-patterns">available on GitHub</a>.

    One of the participants even changed the tutorial's source code to enable it to export a much larger area â€” and laser cutted the complete city center of Budapest.

    Six months later, <a href="https://twitter.com/shravanshah">Shravan Shah</a> used my tutorial during the Maps and Design Course he taught at the <a href="http://www.cept.ac.in/">CEPT University</a> in Ahmedabad, India.
