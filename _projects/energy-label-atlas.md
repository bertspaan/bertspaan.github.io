    The <a href="http://www.energielabelatlas.nl/">Energy Label Atlas</a> shows the energy labels of all houses in the Netherlands. When labels change, the server automatically updates the background map using TileMill and Mapnik. The application is made with D3.js and Leaflet, and talks to a Ruby/Sinatra/PostGIS API.
